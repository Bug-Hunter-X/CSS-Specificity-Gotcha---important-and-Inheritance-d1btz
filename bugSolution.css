The solution focuses on avoiding the `!important` flag altogether:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green;
}
```

By removing the `!important` declaration and relying on the natural specificity of the `.parent .child` selector, the styles are applied predictably. This approach improves maintainability and makes the stylesheet easier to understand and debug.  If the `!important` declaration truly cannot be avoided, comment thoroughly to explain the reason why.
