The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors and inheritance:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red !important;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green;
}
```

In this example, applying `.parent .child { color: green; }` would override `.child { color: red !important; }` due to higher specificity. However, the `!important` declaration can lead to unexpected behavior. The `!important` rule helps to increase the specificity of a CSS declaration, but overusing it can lead to difficulties in maintaining CSS stylesheets and unexpected results.
